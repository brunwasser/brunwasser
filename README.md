- 👋 Hi, I’m Steve Brunwasser. I am a psychologist and prevention science researcher.
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related to the prevention of health problems. So far, my work has focused on (1) perinatal mental health problems and their impact on pregnant individuals and their offspring, (2) depression in adolescence and early adulthood, and (3) youth asthma and allergic disease.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about causal inference, particularly as applied to longitudinal data analysis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to the prevention of chronic health conditions, particularly those focused on the perinatal period. 
- 📫 How to reach me: brunwasser@rowan.edu (https://www.prevscilab.com/index.html)
